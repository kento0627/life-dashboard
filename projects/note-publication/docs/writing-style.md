# Writing style reference

This document captures the author's writing style preferences and common patterns to reproduce the voice in future drafts.

## Tone and voice
- Conversational, first-person narrative with casual spoken rhythm.
- Mix of short and long sentences; keep the flow natural and informal.
- Light humor and self-deprecating remarks are welcome (e.g., "w", "笑").
- Occasional rhetorical questions or asides to the reader.

## Structure patterns
- Start with a strong hook and a clear statement of intent.
- Use section headings that feel conversational and story-led.
- Keep sections chronological: origin → struggle → build → validation → growth → learnings.
- Use horizontal separators (---) between major sections.

## Content motifs
- Emphasize "趣味がビジネスになる" and "行動に移したこと" as the turning point.
- Highlight the gap between rational risk analysis and will-driven action.
- Stress DIY grit (manual labor, lack of budget, weekend work).
- Include vivid before/after contrast and specific numbers (price, occupancy, timeline).

## Language choices
- Use casual interjections: "無理無理無理", "まじで", "やばすぎ".
- Include colloquial emphasis: "ってのは", "みたいな", "くらい".
- Occasional emoji or expressive markers are acceptable when consistent with tone (e.g., "🤣").
- Prefer the author's original phrasing; minimal editorial smoothing.

## Call-to-action
- Close with a short reflection and a gentle invitation to save/read again.
- Optional note of caution or self-aware disclaimer.
